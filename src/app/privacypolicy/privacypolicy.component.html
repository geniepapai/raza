					<p>Raza.com keeps track of the pages our customers visit within our Website in order to determine what pages and services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Raza.com to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

This is similar to the way television ratings tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate and not on an individual basis. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the Website, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible.</p>

For example, if you personalize Raza.com pages, or register with our Website or for our services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, email addresses, and so on. When you return to our Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Website features that you customized.</p>
